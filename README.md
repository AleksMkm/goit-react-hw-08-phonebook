todos:

- sort contacts albhabetically
- create alphabetical sections for contacts
- add a page with 1 contact via modal (why for? may contain additional fields?)
- at least to read about photo upload with forms
- think about adding country prefix to phone field
- will it be an infinite length page (let's assume there are tons of contacts)
  or one screen with pagination? alphabetical pagination?
- header with user login section
- meaningful footer
